///answer the questions as the example states, otherwise it might not work properly
///logscale options works only if F2 is not for specified points
do you want to read values of x, Q2, F2, y, s_r etc. from file "nce-p.txt"? then other options would be unavalible (y/n):
y
number of iterations:
100
Do You want to evaluate F2 function for some special points? (y/n)
y
Otherwise, define the domain
x: 1e-7 1e-2
Q2: 1 100
logharitmic x axis? (y/n)
y
logharitmic Q2 axis? (y/n)
y
if x axis is not logharitmic axis, define number of x values between limits xinitial and xfinal:
10
if Q2 axis is not logharitmic axis, define number of Q2 values between limits Q2initial and Q2final:
10
Write here points (x,Q2) in that form:
1e-7 1
1e-7 10
1e-7 100
